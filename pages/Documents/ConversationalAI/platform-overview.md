### Modules

- [Conversation Builder](conversation-builder-bot-workspace.html) is the primary application that allows you to design and build bots. Leveraging all of the other applications, this is where the user configures and designs conversational flows, API integrations, etc.

- [Intent Manager](intent-manager-overview.html) is for building intents and entities that Conversation Builder uses to more accurately match consumer responses, and for tracking and maintaining intents in real-time.

- [KnowledgeAI](knowledgeai-overview.html) lets you seamlessly leverage your own content to provide answers and engage in rich, automated conversations with consumers. Turn your existing content into conversational knowledge for consumers and agents.

- [Bot Analytics](bot-analytics-overview.html) holds all of the operational and usage data for your bots.

- [Bots Status](bots-status-overview.html) lets you monitor and manage your deployed bots.

- [Bot Accounts](bot-accounts-permissions-per-role.html) is the administration area for managing permissions of Conversation Builder users.

- [Conversation Orchestrator](maven-overview.html) is the Artificial Intelligence engine that runs across the entire Conversational AI suite.
